## Project-Big-Data-Challenge-2020

This is my team project as a finalist in Big Data Challenge, held by SATRIA DATA, Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB) University. Big Data Challenge is a competition for recommendations analytical solutions to real problems. The problems used in the competition are business or operational problems faced by the organizing partners. Problem solving is done using statistical, analytical, and machine learning techniques based on data.
